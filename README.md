# Smart-Car-Accident-Detection-System-IOT

An IoT-based vehicle safety solution that leverages ultrasonic sensors (HCSR04), GPS tracking (ublox neo6m), and motion detection (MPU6050) to provide real-time accident monitoring and alerts. The system runs on an ESP32 microcontroller using MicroPython and features a companion Android app for location tracking and instant notifications. All data is securely managed through Firebase backend services.
